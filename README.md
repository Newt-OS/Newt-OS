# Newt-OS

This repository is for Newt OS stuff and related bug reports because email is annoying.

I make no promises that this will ever be a pretty page.  I am using this in a purely utilitarian way; to store files that are used in Newt OS, and to facilitate bug reports.  This is not an informational page, for that please visit http://newtoslinux.weebly.com

If you have been directed here from my site, and are looking for a place to report bugs, click on the "Issues" tab above.  Please include in your report information about what software was involved, what actions you took to encounter the issue, and any other relevant information.  Thanks!
